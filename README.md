Boost for Heroku
================

Boost for Heroku is a simple app for scaling Heroku dynos from an iOS device.
I created it because managing Heroku apps from a mobile browser is nearly
impossible due to the dashboard interface.

I built Boost with [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/).

If you have a RubyMotion license you can build the app yourself. If not,
the app is available for free in the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id728159221).

I blogged about the app [here](http://www.marcusgartner.com/blog/2013/10/27/boost-for-heroku/).

Please feel free to ping me with any questions or comments about the app.
